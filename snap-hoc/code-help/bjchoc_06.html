<h3>Step 7: Prevent <tt>Score</tt> from going negative</h3>
<p>
The way we implemented the Score variable, there's nothing
preventing <code>Score</code> from going negative. So we're going to want to
add that.  Ask yourself -- how can you conditionally do something
based on a question you need to ask?  For example, how do know to
stop eating a hot dog? When there's nothing in your hand, right? So
coding this up might be something like: <b>When there's still a hot
dog left, take a bite</b>.  Now take that same idea and apply it
to the updating of <code>Score</code>.
</p>
<p>
To help you out, we've given you a command called <code>if</code>, that will execute the commands inside it <i>only if</i> the condition between the <code>(</code> and <code>)</code> is true. A condition often compares two values, so you might say <code>if (x > y)</code> then do something.
