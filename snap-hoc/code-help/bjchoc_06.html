<h3>Step 7: Prevent <tt>SCORE</tt> from going negative</h3>
<p>
Implemented as most users do (and we did), there's nothing
preventing <tt>SCORE</tt> from going negative. So we're going to want to
add that.  Ask yourself -- how can you conditionally do something
based on a question you need to task.  For example, how do know to
stop eating a hot dog? When there's nothing in your hand, right? So
coding this up might be something like: <b>When there's still a hot
dog left, take a bite</b>.  Now take that same idea and apply it
to the updating of <tt>SCORE</tt>.
