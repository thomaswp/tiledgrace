<h3>Step 4: Make Alonzo move by itself if it's not clicked in time</h3>
<p>
In this step, you'll implement a feature that will really make the
game feel like "whack-a-mole" -- you want to have Alonzo move by
himself to a new random position every 2 seconds.
</p>
<p>
Right now, whenever Alonzo is clicked he only turns and moves once, but we want him to keep moving. We can do that by surrounding those two commands with a <code>forever</code> command. Just make sure that whatever you want to repeat goes between then <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> of the <code>forever</code> command. Of course, Alonzo is pretty fast, so we need to tell it to <code>wait( )</code> after every move, to give the player a chance to click on it.
</p>
<p>
If Alonzo gets carried away, remember you can use the Stop button at the bottom of the screen to stop it's movement.
