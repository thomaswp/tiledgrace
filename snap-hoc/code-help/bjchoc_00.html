<h3>Step 1: Make your first Mobile App with only 2 blocks!</h3>
<p>Welcome to the Hour of Code, brought to you by UC Berkeley's <i>Beauty and Joy of Computing</i> (BJC) project. You'll be using <b><i>Snap!</i></b>, a graphical programming language, to make a fun mobile App game. There are 10 steps required to complete this task.  We'll walk you through it, with separate challenges for each step.  If you get stuck, you can either click the "Show me the answer." button to see our version (and then apply the fixes yourself), or click the "Replace my code." button and we'll swap out your solution with ours.
</p>
<p>
You'll be using block-based programming here, where you drag blocks from the palette (left) to the grey script (middle) area of the window.  Blocks click together, and once together, always run sequentially top-to-bottom.  To find out what a block does, right-click on it (control-click on a Mac) and choose <tt>"help..."</tt>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>This first step asks you to program the Alonzo sprite (the yellow character in the <i>stage</i> area on the right) so that it <b>turns around when clicked</b> -- you'll only need the two blocks we provide.  Once you think you're done, you can go to the next step by clicking the "next" button (this will be true for all tasks).
