<h3>Step 1: Make your web game with only 3 lines of code!</h3>
<p>Welcome to the Hour of Code! You'll be using <b><i>Grace</i></b>, a programming language, to make a fun web game. There are 10 steps required to complete this task.  We'll walk you through it, with separate challenges for each step.  If you get stuck, you can either click the "Show me the answer." button to see our version (and then apply the fixes yourself), or click the "Replace my code." button and we'll swap out your solution with ours.
</p>
<p>
You'll be writing your program in the gray box in the middle of the screen. Since Grace only understand certain commands, we've provided a "Code Pallet" on the right, which will give you the commands you'll need to make your game. Commands are run in order, from top to bottom. To find out what a command does, hover over its name with your cursor.
</p>
<p>
Some commands, like <code>whenClicked</code> let you put other commands <i>inside</i> them, between the <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> braces. Also, any line that starts with two slashes is just a comment, and won't be executed by the computer, like this: <code class="comment">// comment</code>.
</p>
<p>This first step asks you to program the Alonzo sprite (the yellow character in the <i>stage</i> area on the right) so that it <b>turns around when clicked</b> -- you'll only need the two commands we provide.  Once you think you're done, you can go to the next step by clicking the "next" button (this will be true for all tasks).
