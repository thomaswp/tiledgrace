<h3>Step 5: Make Alonzo move more often when he's not clicked</h3>
<p>
The idea for this step is to have the time Alonzo waits before moving get smaller each time it's clicked (to make the game more challenging). The delay will start at 2 and drop by 0.1 second with every click.
</p>
<p>
To do this, you can create a <i>variable</i> called delay with the command <code>var delay := 2</code>. This names your variable delay, and sets it to start at 2 seconds. Make sure to place it at the beginning of your code, so they variable is <i>in scope</i> throughout the rest of your code. You can use <code>delay</code> anywhere you could use a number or a command that returns a value. You can also set its value with <code>delay := ...</code> or use it in a calculation, like <code>x - 0.1</code>.
