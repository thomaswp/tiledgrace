<h3>Step 9: Have Alonzo trace where he's been, clearing with high scores</h3>
<p>
The idea with this last and final step before we set you loose to add
features on your own, here we want Alonzo to use the <i>Pen</i> which can 
be in an <i>up</i> or <i>down</i> position.  When it's in its <i>down</i>
position (the tip of the pen is right in the center of the sprite), and Alonzo
is moved from one place to another, the system will draw a straight line
from the first place to the second.  You should lear all the pen
traces when the user achieves a high score (as a gift to them, you'll
clear up the stage).
