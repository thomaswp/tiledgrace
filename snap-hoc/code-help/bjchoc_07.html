<h3>Step 8: Remember and display the Maximum score</h3>
<p>
Using the same ideas as last time, try to create another variable called <code>maxScore</code> that keeps track of the highest score that the player has ever gotten. That means every time the score goes up, you want to <i>conditionally</i> make <code>maxScore</code> equal the new score, as long as it's bigger.
