<h3>Step 6: Implement a <tt>Score</tt> that rises with clicks and falls with misses</h3>
<p>
This step makes your program more and more like a game.  Just like last step,
you want to make another variable 
called <code>score</code> that goes up by 10 points every time Alonzo is 
clicked and down by 1 every time it moves on its own because it 
wasn't clicked.
