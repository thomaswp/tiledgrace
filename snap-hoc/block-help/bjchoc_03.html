<h3>Step 4: Make Alonzo move by itself if it's not clicked in time</h3>
<p>
In this step, you'll implement a feature that will really make the
game feel like "whack-a-mole" -- you want to have Alonzo move by
himself to a new random position every 2 seconds.
</p>
<p>
Right now, whenever Alonzo is clicked he only turns and moves once, but we want him to keep moving. We can do that by putting those two commands <i>inside</i> of a <code>forever</code> block. You may have to drag them out of the <code>whenClicked</code> block first, put them into a <code>forever</code> block and then move them back. Of course, Alonzo is pretty fast, so we need to tell it to <code>wait( )</code> after every move, to give the player a chance to click on it.
</p>
<p>
If Alonzo gets carried away, remember you can use the Stop button at the bottom of the screen to stop it's movement.
