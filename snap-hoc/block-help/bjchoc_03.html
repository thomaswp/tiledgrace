<h3>Step 4: Make Alonzo move by itself if it's not clicked in time</h3>
<p>
In this step, you'll implement a feature that will really make the
game feel like "whack-a-mole" -- you want to have Alonzo move by
himself to a new random position every 2 seconds.

<p>
This
is the hardest of all steps, because it requires you to have a clear 
understanding of the "machine model" of a sequence of blocks.  
Here it is: when a sequence of connected blocks (maybe the one headed by the <tt>When I am clicked</tt> hat block) is running, and that hat block is triggered again while the first one was still running, by default the first one stops running and is forgotten.  So if the script cluster were going to speak the word "Snap!" slowly, and it got interrupted twice, it might say "Sn-Sn-Snap!".
