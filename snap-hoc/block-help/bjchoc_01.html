<h3>Step 2: Make Alonzo move to a random spot when clicked</h3>
<p>
This task involves adding blocks to your step 1 solution so that every time Alonzo is clicked he moves to a random position (between -190 and 190 in the <tt>x</tt> direction, and between -130 and 130 in the <tt>y</tt> direction).  
</p>
<p>
This is the first time you'll be using blocks like <code>goToX( )Y( )</code> that have <i>parameters</i>, indicated by the holes between the ( parentheses ). You also have oval-shaped blocks, like the number block and <code>pickRandom( )To( )</code> that can fit into these holes. These blocks <i>return</i> a value, meaning that they don't do anything on their own, but tell other blocks how to behave.
</p>
<p>
First, try using the <code>goToX( )Y( )</code> block to make Alonzo go to a specific position when clicked. Then, try using the <code>pickRandom( )To( )</code> block to make Alonzo go to a random location instead.
</p>
<p>
Remember, to find out what a block does, hover over its name.
