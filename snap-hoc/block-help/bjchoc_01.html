<h3>Step 2: Make Alonzo move to a random spot when clicked</h3>
<p>
This task involves adding blocks to your step 1 solution so that, every time Alonzo is clicked, he moves to a random position (between -190 and 190 in the <tt>x</tt> direction, and between -130 and 130 in the <tt>y</tt> direction).  
</p>
<p>
This is the first time you'll be using blocks that are shaped like <i>ovals</i>. This means these blocks are used to <i>return</i> values and not to do anything, and they are meant to be dragged into other oval inputs, which will turn white to indicate you can drop them in.
</p>
<p>
Remember, to find out what a block does, hover over it's name.
