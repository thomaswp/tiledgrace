<h3>Step 1: Make your web game with only 2 blocks!</h3>
<p>Welcome to the Hour of Code! You'll be using <b><i>Grace</i></b>, a graphical programming language, to make a fun web game. There are 10 steps required to complete this task.  We'll walk you through it, with separate challenges for each step.  If you get stuck, you can either click the "Show me the answer." button to see our version (and then apply the fixes yourself), or click the "Replace my code." button and we'll swap out your solution with ours.
</p>
<p>
You'll be using block-based programming here, where you drag blocks from the palette (right) to the grey script (middle) area of the window.  Blocks click together, and once together, always run sequentially top-to-bottom.  To find out what a block does, hover over its name with your cursor.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>This first step asks you to program the Alonzo sprite (the yellow character in the <i>stage</i> area on the right) so that it <b>turns around when clicked</b> -- you'll only need the two blocks we provide.  Once you think you're done, you can go to the next step by clicking the "next" button (this will be true for all tasks).
