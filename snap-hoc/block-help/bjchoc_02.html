<h3>Step 3: Welcome the visitor by having Alonzo say a message</h3>
<p>
Up until now, you've been the player of the game, so you've known what to do. It would be good to tell the user how to play the game.  
</p>
<p>
In this task, you'll have Alonzo say a welcome message whenever the Run button is clicked. You'd like to tell the user to click on Alonzo, but have the message disappear once they do so. This one is a little tricky -- note that if Alonzo uses the <code>say( )</code> block with an empty <code>" "</code> as input, he'll stop saying things.
</p>
<p>
You can have multiple <i>routines</i> of code in your workspace at the same time. You already have a routine inside the <code>whenClicked</code> block, which will only run when Alonzo is clicked. You can start a new routine somewhere else. By default, your routine will run whenever the Run button is clicked.
