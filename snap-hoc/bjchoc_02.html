<h3>Step 3: Welcome the visitor by having Alonzo say a message</h3>
<p>
Up until now, you've been the player of the game, so you've known what to do. It would be good to tell the user how to play the game.  
</p>
<p>
In this task, you'll have Alonzo say a welcome message whenever the green flag is clicked (at the top right), which is the normal way Snap! projects begin. They stop by clicking the red stop sign. You'd like to tell the user to click on Alonzo, but have the message disappear once they do so. This one is a little tricky -- note that if Alonzo uses the <tt>Say</tt> block with a blank input, he'll stop saying things.
</p>
<p>
You can have two "clusters" of code, each headed by a "hat block" that starts that cluster running. The great thing about Snap! is that two clusters can run simultaneously.
